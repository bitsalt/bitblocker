# BitBlocker

> **Back to:** [[BitSalt-Projects]]
> **Started:** 2026-04-21
> **Status:** 🟡 In progress
> **One-liner:** Self-hosted Go daemon that silently drops inbound traffic from specified countries at the Traefik edge, for operators running small-scale self-hosted infrastructure.

---

## Overview

BitBlocker is a single-binary Go daemon that blocks inbound scanning traffic from selected countries before it reaches application code. It sits behind Traefik as a `forwardAuth` middleware, maintains an in-memory CIDR trie populated from MaxMind GeoLite2 data, and refreshes itself on a cron schedule. 

v1 ships country-based blocking with IPv4+IPv6 support and a fail-closed security posture; 

v1.1 adds Prometheus metrics and CLI inspection tools. ASN-level blocking via BGP.tools is deferred until the data-source access question is resolved.

| Daemon serves `/check` + `/healthz` with fail-closed cold start | Sprint 3 | ⬜ |
| v1.0 released (binaries + Docker image + operator docs) | Sprint 4 | ⬜ |
| v1.1 observability released (metrics + CLI) | Sprint 5 | ⬜ |

---

## Sprint 1 — Apr 21 to May 4

**Goal:** Repo scaffolded and CIDR trie (IPv4+IPv6) passes unit tests.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Author Go coding-standards addendum at `~/projects/coding-standards/coding-standards-go.md` | ✅ | Pre-Sprint-1 — blocks all coding tasks. Also add reference to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` addenda list |
| Initialize Go module and repo structure (`cmd/`, `internal/…`) per spec | ✅ | Module `github.com/bitsalt/bitblocker`; `cmd/bitblocker` + `internal/{blocklist,fetcher,server,config}` stubs, Makefile, `.gitignore`. `make` not yet installed locally — run `go build`/`go test` directly until then |
| GitHub Actions CI skeleton (build + test on push) | ✅ | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: build, vet, race-enabled tests, `go mod verify`, `govulncheck`. `golangci-lint` deferred — needs `.golangci.yml` (not yet in sprint plan, see Carry-over) |
| Config schema (YAML) with validation | ✅ | `internal/config`: typed structs, `Load`/`Validate`, `MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY` env override, `behavior.startup_mode` knob, `config.example.yaml`. Full cron-expression validation deferred to Sprint 3 scheduler task (avoids pulling `robfig/cron/v3` before it's used) |
| Structured JSON logging setup | ✅ | `internal/logging`: `log/slog` JSON/text handlers selected from `config.LoggingConfig`, `WithContext`/`FromContext` propagation, discard-logger fallback (no `slog.Default()` reads), `Redact()` with stable 4-byte SHA-256 prefix. Not yet wired into `main` — lands with the HTTP server in Sprint 2 |
| CIDR trie supporting IPv4 + IPv6 lookups | ✅ | Bit-level radix trie, separate v4/v6 roots, built on `net/netip`. Insert masks host bits, is idempotent, ignores invalid/mismatched-family prefixes. Contains normalizes IPv4-in-IPv6 via `Unmap`. Benchmarks: ~39 ns/op IPv4, ~211 ns/op IPv6 against 10k-prefix set — comfortably under the spec's 1ms budget |
| Unit tests for trie (insert, lookup, edge cases) | ✅ | Merged with the trie task per TDD — table-driven coverage in `trie_test.go` for single-host, nested, disjoint, dual-stack normalization, idempotency, invalid-input, and mixed-family `Len()` |

## Sprint 2 — May 5 to May 18

**Goal:** Daemon answers `/check` and `/healthz` correctly against a preloaded MMDB fixture.

**Sprint 2 mid-sprint status (2026-05-10 portfolio sprint review).** Request-path slice closed via PR #5 (merge `20b096f`, 2026-05-08): `/check`, `X-Real-IP`/rightmost-XFF extraction, `/healthz`, fail-closed posture, handler tests all ✅. Sprint goal **partially met** — daemon answers `/check` / `/healthz` correctly against an empty `LookupSource` (always-allow stub); the swap+disk-cache slice (atomic swap mechanism + disk cache snapshot read/write) carries through the second half of bitblocker's own 2-week Sprint 2 cadence (May 5 → May 18) and crosses into the platform Sprint 3 calendar window (Mon 2026-05-11 → Sun 2026-05-17). **Per OQ-PORTFOLIO-19 closure 2026-05-10 (portfolio sprint review):** bitblocker Sprint 3 allocation ~6 hr/wk (matches the standing 4–6 hr time-budget envelope; expanded slightly to fit absent rework debt). The swap+disk-cache slice fits the ~6 hr envelope absent rework debt; the seam is the `Lookup` interface contract, where today's empty `LookupSource` becomes an `atomic.Pointer[blocklist.Trie]`-backed source with no server-side change. **bitblocker's own Sprint 3** (May 19 → Jun 1) is outside the platform Sprint 3 calendar window and is unaffected by this allocation.

**Sprint 2 close (2026-05-15).** Swap+disk-cache slice landed via PR #9 (ADR 0001 + ADR 0002 + interface spec shipped via PR #8; implementation via PR #9; `go test -race ./...`, lint, vuln-scan all clean; `go.mod`/`go.sum` untouched). Sprint 2 goal is now **fully met**: the daemon consults a populated trie via `blocklist.Source` backed by `atomic.Pointer[blocklist.Trie]`, with a disk-cache cold-start fast-path (`internal/diskcache` package). See decisions log 2026-05-15 for mechanism details.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Integrate `maxminddb-golang` reader and populate trie from MMDB | ✅ | `internal/mmdb/{doc,loader,loader_test}.go`. Pinned `maxminddb-golang v1.13.1` and `mmdbwriter v1.0.0` (test-only) — both pinned below the Go 1.24 floor that newer releases introduced, to stay compatible with the project's `go 1.22.2` toolchain. Loader uses `Networks(SkipAliasedNetworks)` and switches on `len(net.IP)` to build `netip.Prefix` in the form `Trie.Insert` expects. Country match is on `country.iso_code` only — see Open Questions for the `registered_country` scope decision. Lesson `lessons/maxminddb/version-floors-and-aliasing-gotchas.md` written in agent-knowledge-base. PR #2 |
| Atomic swap mechanism (lock-free via `atomic.Pointer[blocklist.Trie]`) | ✅ | `internal/blocklist/source.go`: `Source` type with `Current()` / `Swap()`. One `atomic.Pointer.Load()` on the `/check` hot path — no lock, no cacheline write. `RWMutex` explicitly rejected in ADR 0001 (adds `RLock`/`RUnlock` to every `/check` for no benefit; the trie is immutable after construction). Wired in `cmd/bitblocker` via a closure returning untyped `nil` when empty (nil-interface-trap guard). PR #9; ADR 0001 |
| Disk cache: write snapshot on successful load, read on startup | ✅ | `internal/diskcache` package (not `internal/blocklist` — placing it there would have created an import cycle: `internal/mmdb` already imports `internal/blocklist`; `diskcache` imports both). Cache artifact is the raw MMDB file (no bespoke codec); startup read calls `mmdb.LoadCountryBlocklist` verbatim — one code path from artifact to trie. Write is temp-file + `Sync` + atomic rename (POSIX crash-safe); staleness check via `Stat` against `cache.max_age` (default 48h). Corrupt or stale cache logs `WARN` and falls back to fail-closed cold start; cache-write failure is non-fatal (`WARN`). Two new config fields: `cache.path` (default `/var/cache/bitblocker/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`) and `cache.max_age` (default 48h) — field placement (dedicated `cache:` block vs. under `behavior:`) is OQ-CACHE-1 (Developer implemented `cache:` block in `config.example.yaml`). PR #9; ADR 0002 |
| HTTP server with `/check` endpoint | ✅ | Request-path slice (PR #5; merge `20b096f`; landing commit `55db825` "server(http): land /check + /healthz request-path slice"). `/check` returns 200/403 against the daemon's `Lookup` interface seam; today's wiring uses an empty `LookupSource`, so all `/check` calls return 200 (allow) until the swap+disk-cache slice replaces it with an `atomic.Pointer[blocklist.Trie]`-backed source. Request-path semantics (header selection, fail-closed, healthz) all in place |
| Client IP extraction: `X-Real-IP` first, rightmost-XFF fallback | ✅ | Landed in PR #5 alongside `/check`. `X-Real-IP` consulted first; falls back to rightmost entry of `X-Forwarded-For` per decisions log 2026-04-22. Leftmost-XFF deferred to a future config knob (Open Question) |
| `/healthz` endpoint (returns 503 while blocklist empty) | ✅ | Landed in PR #5. Returns 503 while `LookupSource` is empty (cold-start posture); flips to 200 once the trie is populated. Empty source today is the "always allow" stub; once swap+disk-cache slice lands, `/healthz` actually reflects ruleset state |
| Fail-closed on unparseable `/check` with WARN log | ✅ | Landed in PR #5. Unparseable IP → 403 + WARN-level structured log via `internal/logging`. Aligns with decisions-log 2026-04-22 fail-closed posture |
| HTTP handler tests | ✅ | Landed in PR #5. `httptest`-based table-driven tests exercise: header-selection precedence, malformed input fail-closed, `/healthz` empty/non-empty paths, `/check` allow/deny against a stubbed `Lookup` |

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-15 | Blocklist swap uses `atomic.Pointer[blocklist.Trie]`, not a pointer-swap under `sync.RWMutex` (ADR 0001). Disk cache stores the raw MMDB file, written via temp-file + `Sync` + atomic rename, with a `Stat`-based staleness bound (`cache.max_age`, default 48h); startup read reuses `mmdb.LoadCountryBlocklist` verbatim (ADR 0002). `Source` type (`Current`/`Swap`) lives in `internal/blocklist`; disk-cache logic lives in `internal/diskcache` to avoid an import cycle (`internal/mmdb` already imports `internal/blocklist`). `go test -race ./...` clean. Landed via PR #8 (ADR 0001 + ADR 0002 + interface spec) + PR #9 (implementation). | Lock-free `atomic.Pointer` is the correct primitive when the payload is immutable after construction and the read:write ratio is extreme (~10^7 reads per refresh on a busy host). `RWMutex` adds shared-cacheline contention to every `/check` for no benefit — `atomic.Pointer.Load()` is a single uncontended atomic read. Go addendum §15 names this case explicitly. Raw-MMDB cache format avoids inventing and versioning a bespoke trie codec; the existing loader is reused as-is. Temp-file + atomic rename is the filesystem analogue of the in-memory atomic swap: a crash at any point leaves either the prior good cache or no cache — never a half-written file. |
| 2026-05-08 | Sprint 2 split into request-path slice (PR #5) and swap+disk-cache slice (separate session) | The five tasks bundled into PR #5 (`/check` + IP extraction + `/healthz` + fail-closed + handler tests) all share the same request-handler code path; landing them together kept the seams coherent and avoided thrashing on the same files across two PRs. The swap+disk-cache slice is the parallel Sprint 2 slice and proceeds against the `Lookup` interface seam — the server defines the interface at the consumer side; today's wiring uses an empty `LookupSource`; the swap slice replaces it with an `atomic.Pointer[blocklist.Trie]`-backed source with no server-side changes. The two slices were intentionally decoupled so each could land thoroughly without one blocking the other; the seam is the contract |
| 2026-04-22 | Cold-start fail mode: fail-closed with guardrails | Authorization gate with no ruleset loaded should default-deny. Disk cache, `startup_mode` config knob, `/healthz` 503, and bounded retry make it operationally tolerable |
| 2026-04-22 | IPv4 + IPv6 supported from Sprint 1 | GeoLite2 ships both; retrofitting the trie later would be painful |
| 2026-04-22 | MaxMind consumed as MMDB binary format (not CSV) | Native Go library `maxminddb-golang` exists; avoids custom CSV parsing |
| 2026-04-22 | ASN blocking via BGP.tools deferred from v1 | Data-source access question unresolved; config schema stays forward-compatible (accepts `block.asns`, logs "not implemented" if populated) |
| 2026-04-22 | Malformed `/check` fails closed; header selection is `X-Real-IP` first, then rightmost-XFF | Leftmost XFF is spoofable under Traefik's `trustForwardHeader: true`; `X-Real-IP` reflects the TCP peer Traefik actually saw. Leftmost-XFF support deferred to a future config knob for upstream-CDN scenarios |
| 2026-04-23 | Raw shell pre-commit hook under `scripts/git-hooks/`, activated via `core.hooksPath`, rather than the `pre-commit` framework | Project is solo and Go-only; adding a Python toolchain for one linter is overkill. Migrating to the `pre-commit` framework later is a half-hour job if the contributor surface grows |
| 2026-04-23 | `golangci-lint` pinned to v2.11.4 in CI; local installs run whatever `go install @latest` resolves | Pinning in CI keeps the gate reproducible; leaving local loose avoids forcing contributors through a specific install ritual. If local and CI diverge, bump the CI pin |
| 2026-04-23 | License: MIT | Lowest-friction permissive license for a small self-hosted infra tool; standard in the Go single-binary ecosystem. Apache-2.0's patent grant and NOTICE machinery don't earn their keep here — nothing in the codebase is patentable (CIDR tries, MMDB lookups, forwardAuth shims are decades-old prior art) and the target audience is hobbyist self-hosters, not F500 legal intake. Relicense is possible later if the project ever heads toward a CNCF/Apache-umbrella home |

## Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| MaxMind license key procurement (blocks Sprint 3 fetcher work end-to-end) | Jeff | ⬜ |
| ASN blocking via BGP.tools — include in v1.x or push to v2? | Jeff | ⬜ |
| Allowlist feature (exempt admin/monitoring IPs) — v1 or later? | Jeff | ⬜ |
| Leftmost-XFF config knob for upstream CDN scenarios — when does this become needed? | Jeff | ⬜ |
| MMDB country match scope: `country.iso_code` only, or also `registered_country.iso_code`? v1 currently matches `country` only; false negatives would be IPs geolocated outside the blocked country but registered inside it. Decide before v1 release; cheap to add later | Jeff | ⬜ |
| Toolchain bump path to unblock `maxminddb-golang/v2` and recent `mmdbwriter` (Go 1.24 floor). Current `go 1.22.2` pin works fine for v1.0; a future feature might want the v2 reader. Separate sprint-level decision. **Refreshed 2026-05-08 (PR #5):** rationale is now feature-unblock AND security-current — eight stdlib `govulncheck` findings against `go 1.22.2` surfaced in CI when PR #5's request-path code path made the lint/vuln jobs meaningful (previously masked because `main.go` was a no-op print). Bumping the toolchain closes the security surface in addition to unblocking the v2 reader | Jeff | ⬜ |
| Pre-existing `govulncheck` findings against `go 1.22.2` stdlib. Originally filed for `GO-2025-3750` (Windows-only `os@go1.22.2`); **refreshed 2026-05-08 (PR #5):** eight stdlib findings now visible in CI — the original `GO-2025-3750` may be among them or distinct. Pre-existing on `main`, not introduced by PR #5; surfaced now because PR #5's request-path code makes the vuln-scan job meaningful for the first time (previous `main.go` was a no-op print). Specific CVE IDs need reconciliation at next DevOps pass against the eight findings; toolchain bump (per the question above) would close all stdlib-rooted findings. Decide per-finding: suppress / document / bump | DevOps | ⬜ |
| `golangci-lint` GitHub Action version: workflow uses action `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6` against pinned linter `v2.11.4`; needs action `@v7` for compatibility with the v2 linter line. Pre-existing on `main`; surfaced 2026-05-08 because PR #5 was the first PR to exercise the lint job meaningfully. Routes to DevOps; not a blocker for the current Sprint 2 slice | DevOps | ⬜ |
| **OQ-CACHE-1** — Config-field placement for the disk-cache fields (`cache.path`, `cache.max_age`): dedicated `cache:` YAML block vs. under the existing `behavior:` block. Architect lean: dedicated `cache:` block — it is its own concern and reads cleanly in `config.example.yaml`. Developer implemented a `cache:` block in `config.example.yaml` (PR #9). Proposed 2026-05-15 by Architect (ADR 0002 § Open questions surfaced). | Jeff / Developer | ⬜ |
| **OQ-CACHE-2** — On detecting a corrupt or stale cache file at startup, should the daemon remove it (so it does not re-trip the next start's load attempt + WARN), or leave it in place? Architect lean: remove it. Low stakes; flagged so the Developer makes a deliberate choice rather than an incidental one. Proposed 2026-05-15 by Architect (ADR 0002 § Open questions surfaced). | Developer | ⬜ |
| **OQ-CACHE-3** — Sprint 4 / DevOps: the systemd unit needs `CacheDirectory=bitblocker` (creates `/var/cache/bitblocker` owned by the service user and ensures the `bitblocker` user has write permission); the Docker image needs the cache path on a writable volume or `tmpfs`. Out of Sprint 2 scope; record here so Sprint 4 deploy work picks it up. Proposed 2026-05-15 by Architect (ADR 0002 § Open questions surfaced). | DevOps | ⬜ |
